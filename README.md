This repository represents the assignments created for an Introductory Computer Science course with C++ at Pasadena City College.

The course stresses the following objectives (taken directly from the syllabus):
- Demonstrate effective use of object oriented programming techniques in the C++ programming language for general and applied problem solving in a real-time computer environment.
- Demonstrate correct use of functions, C++ classes, proper data type usage, operators and expressions, iteration, sequence, selection, and recursion.
- Demonstrate the ability to do proper problem definition, analysis and design, coding techniques, compilation and link, running, testing and debugging, modification, and maintenance of a C++ program.
- Demonstrate an understanding and utilization of concepts involving polymorphism, encapsulation, multiple inheritance, overloading, and dynamic binding in your C++ programs.
- Demonstrate proper use of C++'s unique I/O functions.
- Demonstrate an understanding of C++ file processing in file manipulation.
- Demonstrate a competency in doing modular, structured, and object oriented programming techniques. Demonstrate a level of proficiency documenting internal program statements, external program descriptions, and documentation in the use and operation of the C++ program.
