# CS003A
This repository represents the assignments created for an Introductory Computer Science course with C++ at Pasadena City College.

The course stresses the following objectives (taken directly from the syllabus):
- Demonstrate effective use of object oriented programming techniques in the C++ programming language for general and applied problem solving in a real-time computer environment.
- Demonstrate correct use of functions, C++ classes, proper data type usage, operators and expressions, iteration, sequence, selection, and recursion.
- Demonstrate the ability to do proper problem definition, analysis and design, coding techniques, compilation and link, running, testing and debugging, modification, and maintenance of a C++ program.
- Demonstrate an understanding and utilization of concepts involving polymorphism, encapsulation, multiple inheritance, overloading, and dynamic binding in your C++ programs.
- Demonstrate proper use of C++'s unique I/O functions.
- Demonstrate an understanding of C++ file processing in file manipulation.
- Demonstrate a competency in doing modular, structured, and object oriented programming techniques. Demonstrate a level of proficiency documenting internal program statements, external program descriptions, and documentation in the use and operation of the C++ program.

The assignments themselves have been modified slightly from their original submission state for readability and posterity. Implementations have also been modified with portability in mind. As such, CMake files have been provided and external dependencies between operating systems and their respective libraries are kept to a minimum.
