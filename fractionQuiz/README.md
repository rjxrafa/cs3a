Correct the fraction class and program done in class. (This is an easy assignment!)

Make sure that you have all of the friends that you need for the class!

Write a program that will generate a "fraction quiz" for elementary school children. 

First, the program will ask for the child's name. Then it will ask for how many questions should be generated. The program will then randomly generate questions with two fractions (neither of which will have denominator greater than 25) and an operator. 

At this point, the program will display, for example, 3/4 + 2/3 = ???, and wait for the child's input (read only as a fraction). It will then compare their answer to the correct answer and award points as follows:

0 - Totally wrong.

1 - Right answer, but not reduced

2 - Totally correct reduced answer.
