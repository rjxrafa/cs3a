/* Algebraic polynomial Calculator
The goal of this project is for you to develop a "command line" Algebraic polynomial calculator that will accept up to 26 arbitrarily long algebraic polynomials composed of terms, as described above.

Goal #1. The program, named calculate, if started on the command line with no parameters, when ready for input, a prompt such as INPUT: or COMMAND: must be printed.
After each successful operation, this prompt will re-appear asking for the next command. Naturally, if the user enters just the return key, then the program will terminate.

Goal #2. They can enter one of the following commands: LET, EVAL, or PRINT.
a. The command LET must be followed by a space, then a letter (A – Z), a space, then an equal sign (=), then by the algebraic polynomial the user wishes to assign to this letter. (e.g. LET F = 2X + 4.
The result printed upon successful completion will be F = 2X + 4 in this example.

b. The command EVAL must be followed by a space, then the letter representing a pre-stored algebraic polynomial, followed by the value within parentheses. (e.g. EVAL F(1/4) ) The program will then print F(1/4) = 4 1/2

c. The command PRINT must be followed by a space then the letter representing a pre-stored algebraic polynomial (e.g PRINT F). The program will respond by printing F = 2X + 4, for example.
Goal #3.
2. They can enter one of the following:

a. An polynomial, such as F = G + H, where F, G, and H are all pre-stored algebraic polynomials. Upon completion, the program will print F = 2X + 4, for example.

b. An polynomial, such as F = G - H, where F, G, and H are all pre-stored algebraic polynomials. Upon completion, the program will print F = 2X + 4, for example.

c. An polynomial, such as F = G * H, where F, G, and H are all pre-stored algebraic polynomials. Upon completion, the program will print F = 2X + 4, for example

d. An polynomial, such as F = G’, where G’ is the derivative of G. As with the proceeding, the resultant algebraic polynomial will be printed.

e. This is the same as the above, but with the ability to enter an arbitrary derivative (such as F = G’’’). As with the proceeding, the resultant algebraic polynomial will be printed.

3. They can enter LOAD followed by a file name. This will load up to 26 pre-defined, or saved earlier, algebraic polynomials. (See below for additional when there are more than one parameter on the command line)

4. They can enter SAVE followed by a file name. This will save the contents of the 26 algebraic polynomials to a file.
As with all of the programs that you have done, the program must ensure that files are not accidentally overwritten and so forth. File names for these files must end in “.exp”

RULES FOR COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS
When there is one parameter on the command line after the name of the program, it will load the file associated with that name.
If there is no extension on the name given, the default extension of “.exp” must be added to the file name before opening the file. Conversely, if there is a /h or /? As the parameter, then a “help message” must be displayed to the user and the program terminates.


When there are two parameters on the command line after the name of the program, the first parameter must be the word EXECUTE or RECORD.
The next parameter is a “script” file, which is composed of commands, as stated from the above section which deals with input from the command line.
If the word EXECUTE is present, then the program must read the file and perform all of the statements within the file.
If the word in RECORD, then the program must save to a file all of the commands that the user enters in via the command line.
Script files must have an extension of “.spt”; and, as above, the “.spt” must be added if the user did not provide it.


If there are more than two parameters on the command line, then the program must “error out.” This means to notify the user that the program will be quitting and why it did so.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
All values must be stored in a class called Fraction. This class must be able to handle all operations between decimals, fractions, and integers.

All data must be stored as a Fraction with all output given as a Fraction.

Only ONE input stream function in the main.cpp can be written for reading of input (whether it comes from a command line or a file).
Thus, the input function must be passed a parameter telling it which stream is to be used for the reading of commands.
If the commands are coming from a file, they must be echoed to the screen. If the user is entering them, they must not be echoed.

All strings used must be C++ strings.

Exceptions must be used accordingly. Such as when a file does not exist, divide by zero, invalid input, and so forth.

There must be a class called polynomial that will store the polynomials entered. This class must have Fractions for each term of the polynomial. (Hint: dynamic arrays or vectors)

Terms of the polynomial must be stored in either a structure or a class (preferred).
