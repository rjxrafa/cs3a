This program will read a file of integers, where the first number in the file is the amount of data contained within the file. Using the value just read in, the program will then dynamically create an array of integers, display them in the order that they were read in (in tabular format), sort the numbers, and then display the sorted list of numbers. Upon completion of the above, it will then display the following statistical information:

- The mean.

- The  first, second, and third quartiles of the data.

- The Standard Deviation.

- The minimum and maximum values
